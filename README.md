This tool is designed to create a fully fleshed out, named and described NPC for DND5e 
    as close to plug-and-play with RAW (rules as written) as possible.



The included source materials are:
    The Dungeon Master's Guide
    The Player's Handbook
    Xanathar's Guide to Everything
    (may expand later)




The default for this program is an entirely randomized NPC, with a full, 10-11 part description.

1.) How to run the program:

    a.) Get into the program by typing: cd NPC_maker
    b.) Run the program by typing: python npc_maker.py
    c.) If you would like to make an adjustment to the output:
        - After you call (write the name of) the program, write any of the following inputs immediately after the program:
            ex: to make a Half-Orc, with a basic length description, and strength as their highest attribute, type:
                
                python npc_maker.py halforc basic highstr

        - The list of available output adjustments are listed below.

    Basic: (name and race, appearance, highest/lowest attribute, how they
            interact with the world around them)
