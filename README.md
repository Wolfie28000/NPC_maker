# NPC_maker
A simple plug and play version of NPC creation for DND5e.

This tool is designed to creat a fully fleshed out, named and described NPC for DND5e.

The goal was to make this tool as close to plug-and-play with RAW as possible.

The included source materials are:
    The Dungeon Master's Guide
    The Player's Handbook
    Xanathar's Guide to Everything
    (may expand later)

The default for this program is an entirely randomized NPC, with a full, 10 point description,
but if you want specific options, or a basic 3 point description, after calling the program include any of the following options without quotation marks:

    description length: "basic", "full"
    supported races: "dragonborn", "dwarf", "elf", "gnome", "halfling", "human", "halfelf",   
                     "halforc", "tiefling"
    lifestyles: "modest", "comfortable", "wealthy", "aristocratic", "monsterous"
    attributes: "highstr", "highdex", "highcon", "highint", "highwis", "highcha",
                "lowstr", "lowdex", "lowcon", "lowint", "lowwis", "lowcha"
    talents: 'instruments', 'languages', 'luck', 'memory', 'animals', 'children', 'puzzles', 
             'games', 'impersonations', 'drawing', 'painting', 'singing', 'drinking', 
             'carpentry', 'cooking', 'darts', 'dancing'
